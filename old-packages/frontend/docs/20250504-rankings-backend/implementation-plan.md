- Fix any remaining issues
- Complete API documentation
- Create deployment guide

### Week 6: Deployment and Monitoring

#### Days 1-2: Staging Deployment

- Deploy to staging environment
- Test in staging environment
- Fix any deployment issues
- Set up monitoring and alerts

#### Days 3-5: Production Deployment and Handover

- Deploy to production environment
- Monitor production deployment
- Create handover documentation
- Train team on new features

## Resource Requirements

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

| Risk                         | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Database performance issues  | High   | Medium     | Proper indexing, query optimization, load testing |
| S3 integration problems      | Medium | Low        | Thorough testing, fallback mechanisms             |
| API security vulnerabilities | High   | Low        | Security review, penetration testing              |
| Data migration issues        | Medium | Medium     | Backup strategy, rollback plan                    |

### Project Risks

| Risk                 | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation                                    |
| -------------------- | ------ | ---------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Schedule delays      | Medium | Medium     | Buffer time in schedule, prioritize features  |
| Resource constraints | Medium | Low        | Clear resource allocation, contingency plan   |
| Scope creep          | Medium | High       | Clear requirements, change management process |
| Integration issues   | High   | Medium     | Early integration testing, clear interfaces   |

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All API endpoints are implemented and tested
2. Database schema is optimized for performance
3. Photo upload functionality works reliably
4. Frontend components are integrated with the backend
5. All tests pass (unit, integration, end-to-end)
6. Documentation is complete and accurate
7. The system can handle the expected load
8. Security requirements are met

## Monitoring and Maintenance

After deployment, the following monitoring and maintenance activities will be performed:

1. Regular database backups
2. Monitoring of API performance and errors
3. Monitoring of S3 usage and costs
4. Regular security updates
5. Performance optimization based on usage patterns

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to developing the rankings feature backend. By following this plan, we can ensure that the feature is implemented efficiently, meets all requirements, and is ready for production use.

The plan is flexible and can be adjusted as needed based on feedback and changing requirements. Regular status updates will be provided to stakeholders to ensure transparency and alignment throughout the development process.
