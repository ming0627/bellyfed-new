# Dynamic Country Routing Migration: Progress Summary

## Completed Steps

1. âœ… **Created migration documentation**

   - Created comprehensive country routing migration guide
   - Created JIRA ticket templates for migrating individual pages
   - Created a detailed pages directory removal plan

2. âœ… **Created template and utility files**

   - Created `DynamicCountryPageTemplate.tsx` to standardize migration pattern
   - Created `countryRouteHelpers.ts` with utility functions for country handling
   - Created an example migration file for reference

3. âœ… **Started API routes migration**

   - Migrated `search-restaurants.js` as an example API endpoint
   - API routes now include deprecation notes in their comments

4. âœ… **Added deprecation warnings**
   - Updated `/pages/my/dishes.tsx` with console warnings for developers
   - Updated middleware to add deprecation headers to responses
   - Updated README.md to highlight deprecation status

## Remaining Tasks

1. ðŸ”„ **Complete API route migrations**

   - Migrate all remaining API routes from `/pages/api` to `/src/pages/api`
   - Test to ensure identical functionality

2. ðŸ”„ **Migrate special pages**

   - Ensure `/pages/_app.tsx` functionality is fully covered by `/src/pages/_app.tsx`
   - Confirm all special Next.js pages are properly migrated

3. ðŸ”„ **Update all wrapper components**

   - Add deprecation warnings to all remaining `/pages/my/*` files
   - Test each route to ensure the warning doesn't affect functionality

4. ðŸ”„ **Fix build warnings**

   - Fix any component import issues revealed during the build process
   - Ensure all paths will still resolve after `/pages` is removed

5. ðŸ”„ **Final testing prior to removal**
   - Create a comprehensive test plan for all routes
   - Test all dynamic country routes with various country codes

## Final Migration

Once all tests pass and we have confidence in the stability of the system:

1. Schedule a maintenance window
2. Back up the codebase
3. Remove the `/pages` directory
4. Deploy to staging and verify all routes work
5. Deploy to production

## Potential Issues and Mitigations

1. **Hardcoded references to `/pages/my`**

   - Search the codebase for any imports or references to this path
   - Fix all imports to use the new paths

2. **Client-side navigation issues**

   - Some links may still point to `/my/*` directly
   - The middleware will handle these, but they should be updated

3. **External links and bookmarks**
   - The middleware will continue to support `/my/*` routes temporarily
   - Consider implementing permanent redirects when ready to fully remove support
