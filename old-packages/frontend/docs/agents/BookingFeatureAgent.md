# Booking Feature Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the table booking feature for the restaurant detail page. The feature allows users to book a table at a restaurant by selecting a date, time, and providing their contact information.

## Components Created

### 1. BookTableDialog

- Location: `src/components/restaurant/BookTableDialog.tsx`
- Purpose: Main dialog component for table booking
- Features:
  - Date selection using Calendar component
  - Time slot selection
  - Guest count input
  - Contact information fields (name, phone, email)
  - Special requests text area
  - Form validation
  - Responsive design

### 2. Calendar Component

- Location: `src/components/ui/calendar.tsx`
- Purpose: Reusable date picker component
- Features:
  - Integration with react-day-picker
  - Custom styling
  - Date range restrictions
  - Responsive design

## Integration Points

### Restaurant Detail Page

- Location: `src/pages/[country]/restaurant/[id].tsx`
- Changes:
  - Added "Book a Table" button
  - Integrated BookTableDialog component
  - State management for dialog open/close
  - Dynamic price range display

## Styling

- Added calendar-specific styles in `src/styles/calendar.css`
- Integrated styles into `globals.css`

## Dependencies Added

## Future Considerations

   - Validation of available time slots
   - Email confirmation system

2. Enhancement Opportunities:
   - Real-time availability checking
   - Table selection feature
   - Booking modification/cancellation
   - Integration with restaurant management system

## Security Considerations

- Form validation for user inputs
- Rate limiting for booking requests

- CSRF protection for form submissions

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for form validation
- Integration tests for booking flow
- E2E tests for complete booking process
- Accessibility testing for dialog and calendar components
