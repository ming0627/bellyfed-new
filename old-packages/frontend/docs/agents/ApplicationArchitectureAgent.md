   - Context API (Auth and Country contexts)
   - Local state (React hooks)

3. **UI Components**
   - Tailwind CSS
   - Framer Motion (animations)
   - Embla Carousel
   - Custom UI components

### State Management Architecture

1. **Server State Management**

   - Primary Tool: TanStack Query (React Query)
   - Purpose: Manages all server-side state and data synchronization
   - Key Features:
     - Automatic data caching and invalidation
     - Background data updates
     - Loading and error state handling
     - Optimistic updates
     - Real-time data synchronization

2. **Global Application State**

   - Tool: React Context API
   - Key Contexts:
     - AuthContext: Manages user authentication state
     - CountryContext: Handles country-specific state and preferences
   - Benefits:
     - Reduced prop drilling
     - Centralized state management
     - Simplified component access to global state

3. **Component-Level State**

   - Tool: React's useState and useEffect
   - Usage: Local UI state, form handling, and component-specific logic
   - Implementation: Kept minimal and close to where it's needed

4. **State Management Best Practices**
   - Clear separation between server and client state
   - Optimized data fetching and caching strategies
   - Consistent state update patterns
   - Minimal global state usage
   - Performance-optimized re-renders

## Common Questions & Answers

1. **Q: How does the authentication flow work with country codes?**
   A: The application uses AWS Amplify for authentication while maintaining country context. The flow starts in `_app.tsx` with both `AuthProvider` and `CountryProvider`. Protected routes are managed by the `ProtectedRoute` component, which preserves both the country code and return URL when redirecting unauthorized users to the signin page.

2. **Q: How is the layout structure organized with country support?**
   A: The layout is managed by `PageLayout.tsx`, which includes a country selector in the header. The `CountryContext` ensures all navigation and content are country-specific. The layout adapts based on authentication state, selected country, and screen size.

3. **Q: How does the country-based navigation system work?**
   A: The application prefixes all routes with a country code (e.g., `/my/restaurants` or `/sg/explore`). The `CountryProvider` manages the current country state, while the navigation components automatically include the current country code in all links. Invalid country codes are automatically redirected to the default country (Malaysia).

4. **Q: How is data managed with country context?**
   A: The application uses React Query with country-aware cache keys to ensure data is properly segmented by country. The `CountryContext` provides the current country to all components, and API calls include country parameters to fetch country-specific data.

5. **Q: How is state managed across the application?**
   A: The application uses a layered state management approach:

   - Server state is handled by TanStack Query for efficient data fetching and caching
   - Global UI state is managed through React Context
   - Component-level state uses React's built-in hooks
     This approach provides a balance between performance, maintainability, and developer experience.

6. **Q: How does data caching work?**
   A: TanStack Query handles data caching with configurable settings:
   - 5-minute stale time for data freshness
   - 24-hour cache retention
   - Automatic background updates
   - Smart cache invalidation based on user actions
     This ensures optimal performance while maintaining data consistency.

## Best Practices

1. Always explain the relationship between components and country context
2. Provide specific file locations when referencing components
3. Include both technical details and country-specific considerations
4. Reference both authentication and country state when explaining protected features
5. Consider desktop, mobile, and multi-country experiences in explanations

## Error Handling

1. If a route is not found, explain the country-prefixed available routes
2. If authentication questions arise, reference country preservation
3. For component relationship questions, refer to the country-aware layout hierarchy
4. When discussing features, consider both authentication and country implications
5. Handle invalid country codes with automatic redirection
