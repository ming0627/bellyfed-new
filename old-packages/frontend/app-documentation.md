5. The system prioritizes options with more top rankings, even if they have fewer total votes.

Example calculation:
When searching for the best Nasi Lemak:

- 'Nasi Lemak Antarabangsa' ranked #1 by 10 users (10 points each) = 100 points
- 'Nasi Lemak Royale' ranked #2 by 15 users (9 points each) = 135 points
