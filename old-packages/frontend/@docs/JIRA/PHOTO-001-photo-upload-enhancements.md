# PHOTO-001: Photo Upload Functionality Enhancements

## Description

Following the implementation of the basic photo upload functionality for rankings, this task covers enhancements to improve the user experience, add more features, and optimize performance.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Image Editing Capabilities

- [ ] Implement image cropping functionality
  - Allow users to crop photos before uploading
  - Provide aspect ratio presets (1:1, 4:3, 16:9)
  - Allow free-form cropping
- [ ] Add basic image filters
  - Implement brightness/contrast adjustments
  - Add common filters (grayscale, sepia, etc.)
- [ ] Implement rotation and flipping options
  - Allow 90Â° rotation in both directions
  - Add horizontal and vertical flipping

### Photo Gallery Improvements

- [ ] Create a full-screen photo gallery view
  - Implement lightbox-style gallery for viewing photos
  - Add navigation controls for moving between photos
  - Include photo metadata display (date, restaurant, dish)
- [ ] Add touch gestures for mobile users
  - Implement swipe gestures for navigating between photos
  - Add pinch-to-zoom functionality
  - Support double-tap to zoom
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for gallery images
  - Only load images as they come into view
  - Show loading placeholders for images not yet loaded
  - Implement progressive image loading

### Mobile Enhancements

- [ ] Add support for uploading photos directly from camera
  - Implement camera API integration
  - Add permission handling for camera access
  - Provide fallback for devices without camera support
- [ ] Optimize uploads for mobile networks
  - Implement adaptive compression based on network conditions
  - Add pause/resume functionality for uploads
  - Implement background uploading
- [ ] Add offline support
  - Queue uploads when offline
  - Resume uploads when connection is restored
  - Provide status indicators for queued uploads

### Performance Optimizations

- [ ] Implement client-side image resizing
  - Resize large images before uploading to reduce bandwidth
  - Maintain aspect ratio during resizing
  - Preserve image quality as much as possible
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed images
  - Implement local storage caching for recent images
  - Add cache invalidation strategy
  - Respect browser storage limits
- [ ] Optimize S3 configuration
  - Configure proper CORS settings for direct uploads
  - Implement S3 lifecycle policies for cost optimization
  - Set up CloudFront distribution for faster image delivery

## Technical Notes

- Use browser-image-compression library for client-side image compression
- Consider using react-image-crop for the cropping functionality
- Implement the PhotoEditor as a separate component that can be reused
- Use IntersectionObserver API for lazy loading images
- Consider using the MediaDevices API for camera integration

## Dependencies

- Requires AWS S3 bucket with proper CORS configuration
- Needs AWS IAM permissions for generating pre-signed URLs
- Depends on the existing photo upload functionality

## Estimation

- Image Editing Capabilities: 5 story points (1 week)
- Photo Gallery Improvements: 3 story points (3 days)
- Mobile Enhancements: 5 story points (1 week)
- Performance Optimizations: 3 story points (3 days)
- Total: 16 story points (3 weeks)
