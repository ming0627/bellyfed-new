# PHOTO-004: Photo Management Backend Infrastructure

## Description

Design and implement a robust backend infrastructure for photo management across the Bellyfed platform. This task focuses on creating a scalable, secure, and efficient system for storing, processing, and serving photos for restaurants, dishes, and user rankings.

## Acceptance Criteria

### S3 Storage Infrastructure

- [ ] Configure S3 buckets for photo storage
  - Set up separate buckets or prefixes for different environments (dev, test, prod)
  - Implement proper bucket policies and permissions
  - Configure lifecycle rules for cost optimization
- [ ] Implement CORS configuration
  - Allow direct uploads from approved domains
  - Set appropriate headers for browser security
  - Configure proper cache control settings
- [ ] Set up CloudFront distribution
  - Configure CDN for faster photo delivery
  - Implement proper cache settings
  - Set up custom domain for photo URLs

### Image Processing Pipeline

- [ ] Implement server-side image processing
  - Create Lambda functions for image resizing
  - Set up automatic thumbnail generation
  - Implement format conversion (WebP with fallbacks)
- [ ] Configure S3 event triggers
  - Trigger processing on new image uploads
  - Implement error handling and retry logic
  - Add notification system for processing status
- [ ] Add metadata extraction
  - Extract EXIF data from uploaded images
  - Implement location data handling (with privacy controls)
  - Add image classification and tagging

### Security and Access Control

- [ ] Implement secure pre-signed URL generation
  - Create API endpoints for generating upload URLs
  - Add proper validation and authorization
  - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- [ ] Set up IAM roles and policies
  - Create least-privilege roles for different services
  - Implement proper access controls
  - Set up audit logging for security monitoring
- [ ] Add content moderation
  - Implement automated content filtering
  - Set up manual review workflow for flagged content
  - Create admin tools for content management

### API Development

- [ ] Create comprehensive photo management API
  - Implement CRUD operations for photos
  - Add search and filtering capabilities
  - Create batch operations for efficiency
- [ ] Implement metadata API
  - Add endpoints for updating photo metadata
  - Create tagging and categorization API
  - Implement association management (linking photos to entities)
- [ ] Develop analytics API
  - Track photo views and interactions
  - Implement popularity metrics
  - Create reporting endpoints for usage statistics

## Technical Notes

- Use AWS CDK for infrastructure as code
- Consider using AWS Rekognition for automated content moderation and tagging
- Implement proper error handling and monitoring
- Use AWS Lambda for serverless image processing
- Consider implementing a queue system for processing large batches of images
- Implement proper logging and monitoring for the entire pipeline

## Dependencies

- Requires AWS account with appropriate permissions
- Depends on existing authentication and authorization systems
- Needs database schema updates for photo metadata

## Estimation

- S3 Storage Infrastructure: 5 story points (1 week)
- Image Processing Pipeline: 8 story points (1.5 weeks)
- Security and Access Control: 5 story points (1 week)
- API Development: 8 story points (1.5 weeks)
- Total: 26 story points (5 weeks)
