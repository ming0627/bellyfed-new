# Oishiiteru Deployment Process

## Overview

The Oishiiteru platform uses a modern, automated deployment process built on AWS infrastructure. This document outlines our deployment strategy, tools, and procedures.

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account with appropriate IAM permissions
- AWS CLI configured with necessary credentials
- Node.js 18.x or later installed
- AWS CDK CLI installed globally
- Access to Oishiiteru GitHub repository

## Key Concepts

### Infrastructure as Code

We use AWS CDK to define our infrastructure as code, enabling:

- Version-controlled infrastructure
- Consistent environments
- Automated deployments
- Infrastructure testing

### CI/CD Pipeline

Our continuous integration and deployment pipeline:

- Automatically triggers on main branch updates
- Runs comprehensive test suites
- Performs staged deployments
- Includes automated rollback capabilities

### Environment Strategy

We maintain multiple environments:

- Development (dev.oishiiteru.com)
- Production (oishiiteru.com)
  Each environment has isolated resources and configurations.

## Deployment Process

### 1. Infrastructure Management

- Infrastructure defined using AWS CDK
- Resources organized in stacks by functionality
- Environment-specific configurations managed via context

### 2. Build and Test

- Automated builds via AWS CodeBuild
- Unit and integration tests
- Infrastructure validation
- Security scans

### 3. Deployment Stages

1. Source code retrieval
2. Build and test
3. Infrastructure deployment
4. Application deployment
5. Health checks and validation

### 4. Configuration Management

- Environment variables in AWS Systems Manager
- Secrets in AWS Secrets Manager
- Infrastructure parameters in CDK context

### 5. Monitoring and Verification

- CloudWatch metrics and alarms
- X-Ray distributed tracing
- Custom health checks
- Performance monitoring

### 6. Rollback Procedures

- Automated rollbacks on failure
- Manual rollback commands available
- Recovery procedures documented

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### Failed Deployment

**Symptoms:**

- Pipeline shows failed status
- Resources not updating
- Health checks failing

**Resolution Steps:**

1. Check CloudWatch logs
2. Verify IAM permissions
3. Review recent changes
4. Check resource limits

#### Configuration Issues

**Symptoms:**

- Application startup failures
- Missing environment variables
- Connection errors

**Resolution Steps:**

1. Verify Parameter Store values
2. Check environment configurations
3. Validate service endpoints
4. Review security group rules

## Best Practices

- Always deploy through pipeline
- Test changes in development first
- Monitor deployments actively
- Keep documentation updated
- Review logs after deployment
