# Bellyfed Database Strategy

This document outlines the hybrid database strategy used in the Bellyfed application, explaining when to use DynamoDB and when to use PostgreSQL RDS.

## Overview

Bellyfed uses a hybrid database approach:

- **PostgreSQL RDS**: Primary database for complex data with relationships
- **DynamoDB**: Used for specific high-performance use cases

## When to Use PostgreSQL RDS

Use PostgreSQL RDS for the following types of data:

### 1. Restaurant Data

- Restaurant profiles
- Location information
- Operating hours
- Contact details
- Cuisine types

### 2. Dish Data

- Dish information
- Dish categories
- Dish-restaurant relationships
- Pricing information

### 3. User Rankings and Votes

- User dish rankings
- Voting history
- Detailed review data
- Photos and comments

### 4. User Profiles

- User account information
- User preferences
- Profile data

### 5. Complex Queries

- Any data requiring complex joins
- Data requiring aggregation
- Data with complex relationships

## When to Use DynamoDB

Use DynamoDB for the following types of data:

### 1. Session Data

- User session information
- Authentication tokens
- Temporary state

### 2. Real-time Analytics

- View counts
- Click tracking
- Usage metrics
- Real-time dashboards

### 3. Caching

- Frequently accessed data
- API response caching
- Content delivery caching

### 4. Feature Flags

- Application configuration
- Feature toggles
- A/B testing configurations

### 5. High-throughput Access Patterns

- Data accessed by a single key
- Data requiring extremely low latency
- Data with simple access patterns

## Implementation Guidelines

### PostgreSQL RDS Implementation

1. **Connection Management**:

    - Use connection pooling
    - Implement proper error handling and retries
    - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

2. **Schema Design**:

    - Use proper normalization
    - Implement appropriate indexes
    - Use foreign keys for referential integrity

3. **Query Optimization**:
    - Use EXPLAIN to analyze query performance
    - Implement pagination for large result sets
    - Use appropriate indexes for common queries

### DynamoDB Implementation

1. **Key Design**:

    - Design partition keys for even distribution
    - Use sort keys for range queries
    - Consider access patterns when designing keys

2. **Capacity Planning**:

    - Use on-demand capacity for unpredictable workloads
    - Use provisioned capacity with auto-scaling for predictable workloads
    - Monitor capacity usage and adjust as needed

3. **Data Modeling**:
    - Denormalize data for efficient access
    - Use single-table design when appropriate
    - Consider using GSIs and LSIs for additional access patterns

## Migration Strategy

When migrating data between databases:

1. **Assess Access Patterns**:

    - Analyze how the data is accessed
    - Determine which database is most appropriate

2. **Implement Migration Scripts**:

    - Create scripts to move data between databases
    - Validate data integrity during migration

3. **Update Application Code**:
    - Modify service layers to use the appropriate database
    - Implement proper error handling and fallbacks

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Performance Monitoring**:

    - Monitor query performance
    - Track database metrics
    - Set up alerts for performance issues

2. **Cost Optimization**:

    - Regularly review database costs
    - Optimize queries to reduce costs
    - Consider reserved instances for RDS

3. **Backup and Recovery**:
    - Implement regular backups
    - Test recovery procedures
    - Document disaster recovery plans

## Example: Restaurant Data Flow

1. **Restaurant Profiles**: Stored in PostgreSQL RDS

    - Complex relationships with dishes, reviews, etc.
    - Requires joins and complex queries

2. **Restaurant View Counts**: Stored in DynamoDB

    - High-throughput, simple access pattern
    - Real-time updates and aggregation

3. **Restaurant Search Cache**: Stored in DynamoDB
    - Frequently accessed search results
    - Simple key-value access pattern

## Conclusion

By using a hybrid approach, Bellyfed leverages the strengths of both PostgreSQL RDS and DynamoDB. This strategy allows for complex data relationships while maintaining high performance for specific use cases.

Always consider the access patterns and requirements when deciding which database to use for new features or data types.
