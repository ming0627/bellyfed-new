# Typesense Implementation Fixes

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to fix issues in the Typesense implementation and improve security.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Import in ECS Service Stack

- Added missing import for `addTypesenseEnvironmentVariables` in `lib/ecs/ecs-service-stack.ts`
- This ensures that Typesense environment variables are properly added to the ECS container

### 2. Improved Role Permission Handling

- Updated `addTypesensePermissions` in `lib/typesense/typesense-utils.ts` to handle `IRole` interfaces properly
- Added a check to verify if the role is a concrete `Role` instance before adding permissions
- Added a warning message when permissions can't be added to imported roles

### 3. Fixed Task Definition Memory Configuration

- Updated the `memoryLimitMiB` property to `memoryMiB` in `lib/typesense/typesense-service-stack.ts`
- This ensures that the task definition has the correct memory configuration

### 4. Fixed Duplicate Construct Names

- Renamed `TypesenseFileSystemId` to `TypesenseFileSystemIdOutput` in `lib/typesense/typesense-infrastructure-stack.ts`
- Renamed `TypesenseEndpoint` to `TypesenseEndpointOutput` in `lib/typesense/typesense-service-stack.ts`
- This prevents duplicate construct name errors during CDK synthesis

### 5. Updated Subnet Types

- Changed subnet type from `PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS` to `PRIVATE_ISOLATED` in `lib/typesense/typesense-infrastructure-stack.ts`
- Changed subnet type from `PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS` to `PRIVATE_ISOLATED` in `lib/typesense/typesense-lambda-stack.ts`
- This ensures that the EFS file system and Lambda functions use the correct subnet type

### 6. Improved Environment Variable Handling

- Updated `addTypesenseEnvironmentVariables` in `lib/typesense/typesense-utils.ts` to handle CloudFormation tokens properly
- Added try-catch block to handle errors gracefully
- Simplified the environment variable approach to avoid URL parsing at build time

## Security Improvements

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Better handling of role permissions
- **Network Isolation**: Using isolated subnets for Typesense components
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling in environment variable setup
- **Resource Management**: Correct memory configuration for task definitions

## Future Improvements

See the [Typesense Decoupling Improvements](../TODO/typesense-decoupling-improvements.md) document for recommended future improvements to enhance decoupling, maintainability, and security.
