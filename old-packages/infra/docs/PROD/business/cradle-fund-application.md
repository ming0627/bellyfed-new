## 1. Problem Statement

Current food discovery platforms fail to capture evolving culinary preferences and the dynamic food scene. For instance, a user's opinion of a trendy cafe may change over time, but traditional apps don't easily reflect this shift. These platforms also struggle with temporary vendors; a tourist might miss Penang's famous Char Koay Teow because the hawker stall isn't listed, or a food truck's new location goes unnoticed. Static star ratings are limiting; a 3-star hole-in-the-wall serving authentic Assam Laksa might outshine a 5-star generic eatery for true enthusiasts. Local gems often get overshadowed by popular chains; a hidden Nasi Lemak spot beloved by residents might never appear on a visitor's radar due to low review counts. This gap leaves food lovers without a reliable tool to discover and share authentic, up-to-date dining experiences, while hindering the visibility of unique and temporary food establishments that contribute to the vibrant local food culture.

## 2. Solution

Oishiiteru revolutionizes food discovery with a dynamic ranking platform. Users can easily update their top 10 lists across categories like "Best Nasi Lemak" or "Favorite Bubble Tea," reflecting evolving tastes. For instance, if a user discovers a superior char kuey teow stall, they can instantly update their ranking, influencing real-time recommendations. Our system tracks temporary vendors, ensuring users don't miss out on seasonal treats like Ramadan bazaar specialties or weekend market delicacies. Advanced algorithms spotlight hidden gems; a little-known kopitiam serving exceptional kaya toast might surface based on local enthusiasm rather than review volume. Gamification elements, such as earning "Laksa Connoisseur" badges, encourage exploration. Oishiiteru captures the fluid nature of preferences; a user's favorite roti canai spot last month might differ from today's top pick, and our platform reflects these changes. By bridging user preferences, real-time availability, and temporary establishments, Oishiiteru offers unparalleled, community-driven food discovery.

## 3. Target Market and Go-to-Market Strategy

Oishiiteru's primary target market consists of food enthusiasts and frequent diners aged 18-45 in urban areas, with secondary focus on tourists seeking authentic local dining experiences and tertiary emphasis on restaurants, food trucks, and temporary food vendors looking to increase visibility. Our go-to-market strategy involves a phased rollout starting with major cities in Malaysia, followed by expansion to other Southeast Asian countries. We'll forge partnerships with local food bloggers and influencers to drive initial user acquisition and launch targeted social media campaigns highlighting our unique features and local food discoveries. To create valuable initial content, we'll onboard popular restaurants and food trucks. A referral program will incentivize users to invite friends and share their rankings, while collaborations with tourism boards will promote local culinary scenes. We'll implement a freemium model with premium features to drive revenue while ensuring broad user adoption, balancing growth and monetization.
