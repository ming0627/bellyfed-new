# The Broken Food Discovery Ecosystem

## Trust is Dead

- 5-star ratings lie. Last year's gem is today's disappointment.
- Fake reviews manipulate. Can you trust that glowing recommendation?
- Influencer posts mislead. Paid partnerships â‰  quality cuisine.

## Hidden Gems Remain Buried

- Chain restaurants dominate search results. Local treasures go unnoticed.
- Low review counts = invisibility. New and amazing? No one knows.
- Algorithm bias favors popularity over quality. The best stays hidden.

## Static Systems Fail Dynamic Tastes

- Your palate evolves. Ratings don't. Yesterday's favorite is today's "meh".
- Restaurant quality fluctuates. Stars remain fixed. Reality? Misrepresented.
- Temporary vendors vanish from view. That life-changing food truck? Good luck finding it again.

## One-Size-Fits-All Fits No One

- Your 5-star isn't my 5-star. Personal preferences lost in the averages.
- Tourists fall into traps. Authentic local cuisine obscured by tourist bait.
- Niche cravings go unsatisfied. Hunting for the best laksa? Stars won't guide you.

## The Real-World Impact

- Time and money wasted on overhyped, mediocre meals.
- Incredible culinary experiences missed.
- Deserving local eateries struggle. Diners settle for less.

Oishiiteru: Because in a world of fake hype and stale data, your next unforgettable meal shouldn't be left to chance.
