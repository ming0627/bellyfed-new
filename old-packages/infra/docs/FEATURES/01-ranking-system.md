# One-Best Ranking System: The Foundation of Bellyfed

## Foundation Status

The One-Best Ranking System is the primary foundation of Bellyfed. It serves as the core mechanism that:

1. Enables meaningful food discovery through true personal preferences
2. Creates the basis for credibility that powers the Expert Recognition System
3. Establishes trust in recommendations through clear, accountable choices
4. Provides the data foundation for all other platform features

**Dependency Chain**: All other platform features, particularly the Expert Recognition System, build upon and depend on this core ranking mechanism.

## Core Principles

### 1. Professional Rating Framework

- **Two-Tier Professional Rating System:**
    1. **Top Rankings (#1-#5):** Reserved for exceptional dishes that define excellence
    2. **Taste Status:** Professional assessment categories:
        - `ACCEPTABLE`: Meets professional standards
        - `SECOND_CHANCE`: Requires further evaluation
        - `DISSATISFIED`: Below professional standards

### 2. One-Best Rule

- **Single Authority:** Users can designate only ONE #1 ranking for each dish type at a restaurant
- **Dynamic Evolution:** When a superior version is discovered, previous #1 is automatically demoted
- **Professional Standards:** All rankings reflect verified expertise, not casual opinions
- **Continuous Improvement:** Rankings evolve as experts discover better versions

### 3. Professional Organization

- **Restaurant-Specific:** Maintains professional credibility through venue-specific rankings
- **Cuisine Categories:** Organized by professional cuisine classifications
- **Unique Authority:** Each dish type can have only one authoritative ranking per expert
- **Fair Evaluation:** Ensures professional comparison within same venue context

### 4. Professional Rating Process

**Initial Assessment:**

1. Expert evaluation options:
    - Professional ranking (#1-#5) for exceptional dishes
    - Professional status assessment (ACCEPTABLE/SECOND_CHANCE/DISSATISFIED)
2. Required documentation:
    - Professional notes
    - Verified photos
    - Context documentation

**Ranking Evolution:**

## Enabling the Expert Recognition System

The One-Best Ranking System provides the essential foundation that enables the Expert Recognition System to function:

1. **Credibility Building**: Users establish credibility through consistent, high-quality rankings
2. **Verifiable Expertise**: The ranking history provides concrete evidence of food knowledge
3. **Progression Basis**: Career advancement is based on ranking quality and consistency
4. **Trust Mechanism**: Without the One-Best system, expert credentials would lack verification

Only after establishing a record of quality rankings can users begin to progress through the Expert Recognition System's career levels.
