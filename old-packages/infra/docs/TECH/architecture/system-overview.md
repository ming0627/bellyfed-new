# Bellyfed System Overview

## What is Bellyfed?

Bellyfed is a modern restaurant discovery and review platform. The name "Bellyfed" reflects our mission to help people discover delicious food experiences.

## System Purpose

Bellyfed combines machine learning and user-driven rankings to help people discover authentic food experiences beyond generic ratings and reviews.

## System Overview

### The Big Picture

Think of Bellyfed as a smart restaurant directory with two main parts:

1. **Fast Response System** (like a restaurant concierge)

    - Quickly answers questions about restaurants
    - Shows menus and reviews
    - Helps find restaurants by location or cuisine

2. **Background Processing System** (like a data analyst)
    - Processes new restaurant data
    - Analyzes user behavior
    - Generates insights and recommendations

## Core Components

### 1. User-Facing Components

#### API Gateway (The Concierge)

- Greets all incoming requests
- Directs them to the right service
- Ensures security and proper access

#### Lambda Functions (The Service Staff)

- Restaurant Query: Finds restaurants based on your criteria
- Details Fetcher: Gets detailed information about specific restaurants
- Review Handler: Manages user reviews and ratings

### 2. Background Components

#### Event Processing System

- Processes new restaurant data
- Updates search indexes
- Generates analytics

#### Data Storage

- Restaurant Database: Core restaurant information
- User Database: User preferences and history
- Analytics Database: Trends and insights

## Best Practices

### Security First

- All requests require proper authentication

- Load balancing for high traffic
- Automatic scaling based on demand

### Data Quality

- Validation of all incoming data
- Regular data cleanup and maintenance
- Backup and recovery procedures
