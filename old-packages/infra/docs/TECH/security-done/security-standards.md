# Security Standards and Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the current security implementations in the Oishiiteru platform.

## Authentication and Authorization

### User Authentication

- AWS Cognito implementation with MFA capability
- Session management through Cognito tokens
- Protected routes in React/Next.js frontend
- Token-based authentication

### API Security

- Multi-layer rate limiting:
    - API Gateway throttling (100 requests/sec, 200 burst)
    - Usage plan throttling (10 requests/sec, 20 burst)
    - WAF rate limiting (2000 requests/IP in prod, 1000 in other envs)
- API key management through AWS API Gateway
- Request validation
- CORS configuration with specific origins

## Data Security

### Data Protection

- AWS-managed encryption at rest (DynamoDB)
- HTTPS/TLS encryption for data in transit
- Secure parameter storage in AWS SSM
- AWS-managed key management

### Data Privacy

- Secure handling of user data
- Data access controls through IAM
- Environment-based data isolation

## Infrastructure Security

### AWS Security

- IAM roles with least privilege principle
- Resource access management
- Regional endpoint configuration
- AWS WAF implementation

### Network Security

- AWS-managed network security
- API Gateway security configurations
- WAF rules for IP-based protection
- CloudWatch logging and monitoring

## Security Monitoring

### Logging

- CloudWatch logs integration
- API Gateway access logs
- Lambda function logs
- Error tracking

### Monitoring

- API Gateway metrics
- Lambda metrics
- WAF metrics
- CloudWatch alarms

## Framework Security

### Next.js/React Security

- Built-in XSS protection
- CSRF protection
- Secure routing
- Modern security headers

### API Gateway Security

- Request throttling
- API key validation
- Usage plans
- Access logging

## Compliance

### AWS Best Practices

- Following AWS Well-Architected Framework
- Implementation of AWS security best practices
- Regular security updates
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security
