# Expert Recognition System

## Overview

The Expert Recognition System is a progressive feature of the Bellyfed platform that builds directly upon our foundational One-Best Ranking System. This system transforms passionate food lovers into recognized food experts through a structured professional progression framework.

**Dependency Relationship**: The Expert Recognition System requires the data foundation established by the One-Best Ranking System to function. Without the credibility established through consistent, high-quality rankings, the progression through expert levels cannot be meaningfully validated.

## Career Progression Framework

## Dependencies on One-Best Ranking System

The Expert Recognition System is deeply integrated with and dependent on the One-Best Ranking System:

1. **Data Foundation**: All expertise metrics are calculated from ranking data
2. **Quality Assessment**: Ranking quality determines expertise level eligibility
3. **Consistency Tracking**: Career progression requires consistent ranking behavior
4. **Specialization Evidence**: Badges require demonstrated expertise in the ranking system
5. **Trust Building**: Community trust is established through ranking history

Without the structured, verifiable data from the One-Best Ranking System, the Expert Recognition System cannot function effectively. The One-Best system must be implemented and established before the Expert Recognition features can be fully activated.

## Implementation Timeline

The Expert Recognition System will be rolled out in phases, following the establishment of the One-Best Ranking System:

1. **Foundation Phase**: Core One-Best Ranking System fully implemented and adopted
2. **Basic Recognition**: Initial career levels (1-3) and basic badges
3. **Advanced Progression**: Full career path (levels 1-7) and comprehensive badges
4. **Monetization Layer**: Expert tour tools and premium content capabilities
5. **Full Professional Suite**: Complete set of professional tools and opportunities

Each phase builds upon the data from the One-Best Ranking System, with increasingly sophisticated features unlocked as the platform matures.
