# Bellyfed Platform Overview

## Core Vision

Bellyfed is a dish-centric food review platform built on our innovative One-Best Ranking System. This foundational system enables users to curate and maintain personal "best-of" lists that evolve as they discover superior dishes. Building upon this core ranking system, we enable passionate food lovers to transform into professional food experts through our structured recognition framework.

## Platform Architecture

The Bellyfed platform is built on a clear dependency hierarchy:

```
One-Best Ranking System (FOUNDATION)
├── Expert Recognition System
│   ├── Monetization Features
│   └── Professional Tools
├── Discovery Features
│   ├── Personalized Recommendations
│   └── Social Sharing
└── Data Intelligence
    ├── Trend Analysis
    └── Quality Metrics
```

This architecture ensures that all platform capabilities are built upon the solid foundation of the One-Best Ranking System, with each additional feature or layer extending its core functionality.

## Core Foundation: One-Best Ranking System

The One-Best Ranking System is the primary foundation that all other platform features are built upon. This system creates the essential data structure and user behavior patterns that enable everything else.
