# Rankings Feature Implementation Status

This document provides an overview of what has been implemented and what remains to be implemented for the Rankings feature.

## Implemented Components

As of May 2024, the following components have been implemented:

### Database

- ✅ Basic rankings table schema in `migrations/rankings-tables.sql`
    - Note: This is a simplified version of the schema described in the documentation
    - The current schema only includes a single `rankings` table, not the three tables described in the documentation

### Infrastructure

- ✅ S3 bucket for storing ranking photos (`lib/s3/rankings-bucket-stack.ts`)
    - Includes CORS configuration for frontend uploads
    - Includes lifecycle rules for cost optimization
    - Includes bucket policy for security
- ✅ IAM policies for accessing the rankings S3 bucket (`lib/iam/rankings-iam-policies.ts`)
- ✅ Database migration Lambda function for deploying the rankings schema

## Not Yet Implemented

## Notes

The documentation in this directory serves as a plan for the full implementation of the Rankings feature. The current implementation is just the beginning of the feature, and this documentation will be useful for completing the implementation.
