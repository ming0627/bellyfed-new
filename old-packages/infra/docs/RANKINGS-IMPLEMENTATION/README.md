# Rankings Feature Implementation

Welcome to the Rankings Feature Implementation documentation. This comprehensive guide provides detailed instructions for implementing the Rankings feature in the Bellyfed application.

## Introduction

The Rankings feature allows users to:

- Rank dishes on a scale of 1-5 or with taste status (Acceptable, Second Chance, Dissatisfied)
- Add notes and photos to their rankings
- View their own rankings across restaurants
- See local and global rankings for dishes
- Upload and view photos of dishes with their rankings

## Implementation Structure

The implementation is organized into three main phases:

1. **Backend Implementation** - Database, API, and infrastructure
2. **Frontend Implementation** - UI components and state management
3. **Testing** - Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests

## Documentation Structure

Each phase has its own directory with numbered files indicating the order of implementation:
