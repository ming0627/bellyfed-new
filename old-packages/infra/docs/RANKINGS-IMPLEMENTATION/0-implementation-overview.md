# 0. Rankings Feature Implementation Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the Rankings feature implementation plan.

## Feature Description

The Rankings feature allows users to:

- Rank dishes on a scale of 1-5 or with taste status (Acceptable, Second Chance, Dissatisfied)
- Add notes and photos to their rankings
- View their own rankings across restaurants
- See local and global rankings for dishes
- Upload and view photos of dishes with their rankings

## Implementation Phases

The implementation is organized into three main phases:

1. **Backend Implementation** (2 weeks)

    - Database services
    - API routes
    - Photo upload service
    - Authentication and security
    - Validation and error handling

2. **Frontend Implementation** (4 weeks)

    - API integration
    - Core components
    - Pages and routes
    - State management

3. **Testing** (2 weeks)
    - Backend testing
    - Frontend testing
    - End-to-end testing

Total estimated time: 8 weeks

## Technical Stack

### Backend

- Next.js API Routes
- PostgreSQL Database
- AWS S3 for photo storage
- JWT for authentication

### Frontend

- React with Next.js
- Material UI for components
- React Hook Form for forms
- Context API for state management

### Testing

- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Cypress for end-to-end testing

## Implementation Approach

1. Start with the backend implementation to establish the data layer and API endpoints
2. Implement the frontend components and pages that interact with the API
3. Add state management to handle data across components
4. Write comprehensive tests to ensure functionality works as expected

## Success Criteria

The Rankings feature will be considered successfully implemented when:

1. Users can create, update, and delete rankings for dishes
2. Users can upload photos with their rankings
3. Users can view their own rankings across restaurants
4. Users can see local and global rankings for dishes
5. All tests pass with at least 80% code coverage
6. The feature works across all supported browsers and devices
