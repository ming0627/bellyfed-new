# TYPESENSE-1: Implement Decoupling Improvements for Typesense Integration (COMPLETED)

## Summary

Implement architectural improvements to enhance decoupling, maintainability, and security of the Typesense integration.

## Description

The current Typesense implementation has several areas where components are tightly coupled, making the system harder to maintain and test. This task involves implementing the recommended decoupling improvements that enhance maintainability, testability, and security of the Typesense integration.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create a `TypesenseParameterStore` class to abstract parameter store interactions
- [x] Implement a configuration interface for Typesense parameters
- [x] Update Lambda stacks to use dependency injection for security groups
- [x] Create interfaces for all major Typesense components
- [x] Update existing code to use the new abstractions
- [x] Add comprehensive documentation for the new components
- [x] Ensure all tests pass after the changes

## Technical Details

The implementation follows these patterns:

1. Parameter store abstraction - Created TypesenseParameterStore class
2. Configuration interface - Created TypesenseConfiguration interface
3. Dependency injection for security groups - Created TypesenseSecurityConfig interface
4. Interface-based design - Created ITypesenseService interface
5. Consistent error handling - Added proper error handling in all components

See the [Typesense Decoupling Implementation](../IMPLEMENTATION/backend/typesense-decoupling.md) document for details.

## Benefits

- Improved maintainability
- Better testability
- Clearer component boundaries
- More resilient to changes
- Enhanced security through better isolation

## Priority

Medium

## Estimated Story Points

5

## Dependencies

None - can be implemented independently of other tasks
