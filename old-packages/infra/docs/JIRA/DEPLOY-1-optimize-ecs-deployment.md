# DEPLOY-1: Optimize ECS Deployment Process

## Summary

Optimize the ECS deployment process to reduce deployment time and improve reliability.

## Description

The current ECS deployment process can be slow and sometimes unreliable, especially during high-traffic periods. This task involves optimizing the deployment process to reduce deployment time and improve reliability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Reduce deployment time by at least 30%
- [ ] Implement health check improvements to detect deployment issues earlier
- [ ] Add deployment circuit breaker with automatic rollback
- [ ] Implement blue-green deployment capability
- [ ] Add comprehensive deployment metrics and monitoring
- [ ] Update deployment documentation to reflect the new process
- [ ] Create runbook for handling deployment failures

## Technical Details

The implementation should include:

1. **Optimized Task Definition Updates**:

    ```typescript
    // Use immutable task definitions
    const taskDefinition = new ecs.TaskDefinition(this, 'TaskDef', {
        family: `${props.environment}-app-${Date.now()}`, // Unique name
        // ...other properties
    });
    ```

2. **Improved Health Checks**:

    ```typescript
    // Add more comprehensive health checks
    const targetGroup = new elbv2.ApplicationTargetGroup(this, 'TargetGroup', {
        // ...
        healthCheck: {
            path: '/health',
            interval: cdk.Duration.seconds(15),
            timeout: cdk.Duration.seconds(5),
            healthyThresholdCount: 2,
            unhealthyThresholdCount: 2,
            healthyHttpCodes: '200-299',
        },
    });
    ```

3. **Deployment Circuit Breaker**:
    ```typescript
    // Add deployment circuit breaker
    const service = new ecs.FargateService(this, 'Service', {
        // ...
        deploymentController: {
            type: ecs.DeploymentControllerType.ECS,
        },
        circuitBreaker: { enable: true, rollback: true },
    });
    ```

## Benefits

- Faster deployments
- More reliable deployments
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Better visibility into deployment status
- Reduced downtime during deployments
- Improved developer experience

## Priority

High

## Estimated Story Points

8

## Dependencies

None - can be implemented independently of other tasks
