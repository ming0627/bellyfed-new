Place all Next.js application code in bellyfed/, including pages, components, API routes, and Dockerfile.
Place all infrastructure-as-code in bellyfed-infra/, including CDK/Terraform stacks, pipeline definitions, and IAM configurations.
Put UI, styles, and React/Next.js code only under bellyfed/.

Assume bellyfed-infra/ for any request mentioning “stack,” “pipeline,” “cloud,” “CDK,” or “Terraform.”
Assume bellyfed/ for any request mentioning “page,” “component,” “UI,” “styles,” “hook,” or “API route.”
Ask “Should this change go in bellyfed/ or bellyfed-infra/?” if the correct location is unclear.
Always prefix file paths with bellyfed/... or bellyfed-infra/... when referring to code locations.
Never generate React/Next.js code in bellyfed-infra/ or CDK/Terraform code in bellyfed/.
After generating code, confirm exactly where you added or modified files (e.g. “Added foo.ts in bellyfed/src/pages/...”).
