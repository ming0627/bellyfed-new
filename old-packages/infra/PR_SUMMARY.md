# PR Summary: Use Official Typesense Docker Image from Docker Hub

## Overview

This PR implements the changes required to use the official Typesense Docker image directly from Docker Hub instead of building and storing a custom image in ECR. This simplifies the deployment process and reduces maintenance overhead.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed TypesenseEcrStack**:

    - Deleted `lib/typesense/typesense-ecr-stack.ts` as it's no longer needed
    - Removed references to this stack in `lib/cicd-stack.ts` and `bin/cdk.ts`
    - Removed all ECR-related code and dependencies

2. **Updated Typesense Service Stack**:

    - Modified `lib/typesense/typesense-service-stack.ts` to directly use the official Typesense Docker image from Docker Hub
    - Updated to use the latest Typesense version (28.0)
    - Maintained the SSM parameter for the Docker image URI for reference
    - Removed all ECR-related code and dependencies

3. **Updated CICD Pipeline**:

    - Removed the TypesenseEcrStack deployment step from the Bootstrap stage
    - Updated comments to reflect the use of the official Docker Hub image

4. **Updated Documentation**:
    - Updated `docker/typesense/README.md` to reflect the new approach
    - Simplified the Dockerfile to just contain deprecation notices
    - Updated `docker/typesense/build-and-push.sh` to clearly indicate it's deprecated
    - Updated documentation files to mark ECR-related content as deprecated

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Deployment**: No need to build and push a custom Docker image
2. **Reduced Maintenance**: Using the official image means we don't need to maintain our own image
3. **Improved Reliability**: The official image is well-tested and maintained by the Typesense team
4. **Cost Savings**: No need to store custom images in ECR
5. **Latest Features**: Using the latest Typesense version (28.0) provides access to the newest features and bug fixes

## Testing

The changes have been tested by:

1. Running `cdk synth` to ensure the CloudFormation templates are generated correctly
2. Verifying that the Typesense service stack correctly references the official Docker Hub image
3. Ensuring all dependencies are properly updated to reflect the removal of the TypesenseEcrStack

## Next Steps

After merging this PR, we should:

1. Deploy the changes to the development environment to verify everything works as expected
2. Update any documentation that references the custom Typesense Docker image
3. Clean up any unused ECR repositories related to Typesense
